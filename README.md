# BlacklistedServerChecking

1: Create a user account and join all the servers you want checked for your members.

2: Fill out `blacklist_config.json.example` in files and rename to `blacklist_config.json`. 
- The user bot token must be the bot you just created. Google "How to get discord user token" for how to get a user token. The bot token must be a bot in your server with rights to kick or ban members based on your config settings. 
- `POUND_LEVEL` in the config can either be `KICK` or `BAN`.
- Home Servers and Home Server IDs are an array, so you can add as many as you would like. This bot is multi-server capable.
- Add `%SPOOFSERVER%` anywhere in the config message to name the server the blacklisted server they have joined. **DO NOT** user this for the `Joined_My_Server_While_In_Spoof_Servers_Warning` config as they may be in multiple blasklisted servers when they join your server. 

3: Install node.js if not alread on your machine. 

4: Run `git clone https://github.com/RussellG89/Blacklisted-Server-Checking.git` in your terminal.

5: cd to the cloned directory

6: Install required npm modules
  - `npm install moment`
  - `npm install moment-timezone`
  - `npm install discord.js`
  - `npm install pm2`

7: Start the script using `pm2 start Blacklisted.js`

All Commands must be preceeding by the command prefix in your config file and in the specified channel.
Commands: 
- `help` -> lists commands you can use
- `check all` -> Checks all users in your server for membership to blacklisted servers.
- `check all sudo` -> Checks all users and ignores your whitelist.

This bot will automatically monitor users onjoin to your server as well as all of the blacklisted servers. It does not do a check on start-up, so you will need to run a `check all` once started. As long as it is running, it is watching.
